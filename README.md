In this project, you'll build an online portfolio to showcase the work you've created as part of this program and any projects you've built on your own. This is your chance to show the world (and potential employers) the work you've done. In fact, the portfolio site itself is a great way to show what you can do. Bring all of your talents with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to create a fun and interactive online portfolio.

You'll host the portfolio site on the web either using a traditional web hosting company or use free GitHub Pages hosting.

We aren't supplying any files for this project: what it looks like and how it works is up to you. You can use a framework like Twitter Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation, or simply build the HTML and CSS from scratch. The design is up to you, but see the Resources section for our courses on using frameworks and example portfolio sites you can use for inspiration.
